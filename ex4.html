        /*
        John and his family went on a holiday and went to 3 different restaurants. The bills were $124, $48 and $268.
        To tip the waiter a fair amount, John created a simple tip calculator (as a function). He likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $50, 15% when the bill is between $50 and $200, and 10% if the bill is more than $200.
        In the end, John would like to have 2 arrays:
        1) Containing all three tips (one for each bill)
        2) Containing all three final paid amounts (bill + tip).
        (NOTE: To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it with 20/100 = 0.2)
        GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
        */

        var restaurantBills = [124, 48, 268];

        function calculateTip(bills) {
            var tips = [];
            for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
                if (bills[i] < 50) {
                    tips[i] = (0.2 * bills[i]);
                } else if ((bills[i] >= 50) && (bills[i] < 200)) {
                    tips[i] = (0.15 * bills[i]);
                } else {
                    tips[i] = (0.1 * bills[i]);
                }
            }

            return tips;
        }


        var restaurantTips = calculateTip(restaurantBills);

        console.log(restaurantTips);

        var finalValues = new Array;

        for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            finalValues[i] = restaurantBills[i] + restaurantTips[i];
